# Word2Vec in pure NumPy

**Word2Vec in pure NumPy** is a from-scratch implementation of the Skip-Gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS) algorithm that learns dense vector representations of words directly from raw text. The goal is to train word embeddings where semantically similar words are located close to each other in vector space.

The project demonstrates end-to-end understanding of word embedding training — from text preprocessing and skip-gram pair generation to manual loss computation, gradient updates, and semantic inference using cosine similarity.
